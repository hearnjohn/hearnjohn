Hi, I’m John. I'm currently a software development engineer at Amazon Web Services. I’m interested in blockchain technology and its applications, mainly web3 and specifically DeFi. I’m currently learning about web development and just general development workflows. You can reach me about any opportunities at hearnjohnm@gmail.com
